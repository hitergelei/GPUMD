Analyzing neighbor duplicates and periodic image handling

I'm trying to understand why the neighbor list from the Python script has duplicates while GPUMD uses only unique neighbors via the minimal image convention. The key point is that although duplicates don't affect pair potential energy, they are crucial for vector-dependent terms like mu and lambda in the ADP potential. To match LAMMPS behavior, I need to modify the GPU neighbor list to include periodic image neighbors beyond the minimal image, carefully adding shift vectors using the simulation box matrix and determining replication counts per dimension based on the cutoff radius and box thickness. This means looping over periodic shifts and computing actual displacement vectors without applying the minimal image convention in order to capture all relevant neighbor images.

Evaluating self-interactions and neighbor list strategy adjustments

I'm sorting out whether interactions with an atom’s own periodic images should be included—in fact, they must be included if shifted images differ from zero shift, but the central cell self-interaction is excluded. This affects neighbor list construction, especially with duplicates. Since cell lists currently use minimal image and can’t handle duplicates well, I plan to introduce a condition that switches to brute-force neighbor search when the cutoff exceeds half the box thickness, enabling proper inclusion of duplicates and periodic images beyond minimal image conventions. This involves updating logic to detect such cases and adjusting neighbor building accordingly.

# Ta ADP Validation Notes

## Background
While validating the Ta ADP potential against the analytic Python/ASE implementation, we found that GPUMD under-counted neighbor pairs for this configuration. The simulation box length (9.93 Å) is smaller than twice the ADP cutoff (6.150959 Å), so valid neighbors cross more than one periodic image in each direction. The original ADP neighbor builder relied on the minimal-image convention and therefore discarded these "ghost" interactions, producing ~46 neighbors/atom and a ~4 eV energy deficit.

## Shift encoding fix
To recover the missing interactions, the ADP brute-force builder now replicates periodic images explicitly whenever `rc > thickness/2` in any periodic direction. For every stored neighbor `(i, j)` we also save a compact shift code that captures how many lattice vectors were applied along x/y/z. The force kernels decode this shift to reconstruct the same displacement used during neighbor construction, so the mu/λ accumulators and pair forces use the true geometry rather than reapplying a generic MIC.

Key pieces in `src/force/adp.cu`:
- `encode_neighbor_shift` / `decode_neighbor_shift`: pack the integer image offsets into a 16‑bit token (zero means no extra shift).
- `build_neighbor_ON2`: loops over the required image replicas when the cutoff exceeds the half-thickness, stores both the neighbor index and its shift code.
- `find_force_adp_step1` / `find_force_adp_step2`: decode the shift code per neighbor, adjust the displacement vector, and fall back to `apply_mic` when no shift is stored.

This keeps memory overhead minimal (one extra `int` slot per neighbor) and preserves deterministic ordering, while ensuring ADP energy/force tallies match the reference implementation.

## Verification evidence
After rebuilding GPUMD, running `run.in` in this directory now gives:

- Total energy: **−437.2577487 eV**
- Pair energy: **−180.1500039 eV**
- Embedding:   **−257.1099942 eV**
- ADP term:     **+0.00224933 eV**
- Average neighbors/atom: **58** (identical to the Python/Torch neighbor list)

These numbers coincide with the analytic Torch/ASE results recorded in `adp_energy_breakdown.txt`, confirming that the neighbor accounting and all derived quantities (forces, stress) are now consistent.
